# CustomJukebox
Play your own music through the jukebox in your PocketMine Server. And yes... I was using ChatGPT for the concept, and just rolled with it. 
Feel free to steal the code, but please give credit me as a contributor if you do. 

## Main.php
this is the first attempt that kinda worked with a pointy stick... 
Literally plays music wherever you point the stick

## Main2.php
My failed attempt at making a jukebox that plays music when you right click it.

## Credits
- ChatGPT, ofc. 
- [Sneaky_Snitch_Kevin_MacLeod.ogg](http://incompetech.com) - Used as a placeholder sound. Would kinda fit the minecraft jukebox vibe ig too.
